<Tip>Resend was built by the same team that created React Email, which makes this our recommendation to send emails.</Tip>

## 1. Install dependencies

Get the [Resend Node.js SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/resend).

::: code-group

```console [pnpm]
pnpm add resend
```

```console [npm]
npm addresend
```

```console [yarn]
yarn addresend
```

:::

## 2. Create an email using React

Start by building your email template in a `.jsx` or `.tsx` file.

```jsx email.jsx
import * as React from 'react';
import { Html } from '@jsx-email/html';
import { Button } from '@jsx-email/button';

export function Email(props) {
  const { url } = props;

  return (
    <Html lang="en">
      <Button href={url}>Click me</Button>
    </Html>
  );
}

export default Email;
```

## 3. Send email

::: tipWhen integrating with other services, you need to convert your React template into HTML before sending. Resend takes care of that for you.:::

Import the email template you just built and use the Resend SDK to send it.

```jsx index.jsx
import { Resend } from 'resend';
import { Email } from './email';

const resend = new Resend('re_123456789');

resend.sendEmail({
  from: 'you@example.com',
  to: 'user@gmail.com',
  subject: 'hello world',
  react: <Email firstName="John" product="MyApp" />,
});
```
