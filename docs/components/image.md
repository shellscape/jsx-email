<!--@include: @/include/header.md-->

<!--@include: @/include/install.md-->

## Usage

Add the component to your email template. Include styles where needed.

```jsx
import { Img } from 'jsx-email';

const Email = () => {
  return <Img src="cat.jpg" alt="Cat" width="300" height="300" />;
};
```

::: tip
All email clients can display `.png`, `.gif`, and `.jpg` images.
Unfortunately, `.svg` images are not well supported, regardless of how they're
referenced, so avoid using these. See [Can I
Email](https://www.caniemail.com/features/image-svg/) for more information.
