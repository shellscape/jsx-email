## 1. Install

We recommend using `create-email`, which sets up everything automatically for you.

::: code-group

```console [foo]
npx create-email@latest
```

```console [npm]
yarn create email
```

```console [yarn]
pnpm create email
```

:::

This will create a new folder called `jsx-email-starter` with a few email templates.

## 2. Run locally

First, install the dependencies:

::: code-group

```console [pnpm]
pnpm add
```

```console [npm]
yarn
```

```console [yarn]
pnpm install
```

:::

Then, run the development server:

::: code-group

```console [foo]
npm run dev
```

```console [npm]
yarn dev
```

```console [yarn]
pnpm dev
```
