## 1. Install

We recommend using `create-email`, which sets up everything automatically for you.

::: code-group

```sh npm
npx create-email@latest
```

```sh yarn
yarn create email
```

```sh pnpm
pnpm create email
```

:::

This will create a new folder called `react-email-starter` with a few email templates.

## 2. Run locally

First, install the dependencies:

::: code-group

```sh npm
npm install
```

```sh yarn
yarn
```

```sh pnpm
pnpm install
```

:::

Then, run the development server:

::: code-group

```sh npm
npm run dev
```

```sh yarn
yarn dev
```

```sh pnpm
pnpm dev
```
