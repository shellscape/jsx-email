## Dark and Light Mode

Email clients handle dark/light mode differently than web browsers. Key considerations:

- Gmail and Outlook Windows have limited color-switching support
- Different handling than web development

Recommended resources:

- [Ultimate Guide to Dark Mode for Email](https://www.litmus.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-dark-mode-for-email-marketers)
- [Color Scheme Web Development Guide](https://web.dev/articles/color-scheme)

## Preview App Deployment

Yes, you can deploy your own preview app! Use the CLI to build a custom, deployable preview app with your templates.

See [CLI Documentation](/core/cli#deploying-your-preview-app) for details.

## Gmail and Tailwind

Gmail has strict CSS class restrictions. When using the `<Tailwind/>` component:

```jsx
<Tailwind production={true}>{/* Your email content */}</Tailwind>
```

Setting `production: true` ensures Gmail compatibility by hashing and combining class names.

## Monorepo Support

JSX-email works natively with most monorepo setups without additional configuration.

## Next.js Build Issues

### Error Description

If you encounter this error during Next.js builds:

```
8058.js from Terser
  x await isn't allowed in non-async function
```

This is a [known issue with Next.js and Webpack](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/57535) related to server actions in client components.

### Solutions

#### Option 1: Restructure Imports

Pass server actions through props:

```jsx
// page.jsx
import { MyForm } from './MyForm';
import { myEmailAction } from './myEmailAction';

export async function Page() {
  return <MyForm action={myEmailAction} />;
}
```

```jsx
// MyForm.jsx
'use client';
export function MyForm({ action }) {
  // Note the passing of `action` as a prop
  return <form action={action}>...</form>;
}
```

```jsx
// myEmailAction.js
'use server';
import { render } from 'jsx-email';
import { MyEmail } from '@/emails/MyEmail';

export async function myEmailAction() {
  const body = await render(<MyEmail />);
  // ...
}
```

#### Option 2: Disable ESM Externals

Modify `next.config.js`:

```js
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    esmExternals: false
  }
};

module.exports = nextConfig;
```

## How do I use React context?

Import context helpers from jsx-email instead of from React.

```jsx
import { createContext, useContext } from 'jsx-email';
```
