import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import { Image } from "astro:assets";
import Preview_1 from "@assets/preview-1.png"
import Preview_2 from "@assets/preview-2.png"
import Preview_3 from "@assets/preview-3.png"
import Preview_4 from "@assets/preview-4.png"

## Install

Install JSX email from your command line:

<Tabs syncKey="install">
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
    ```sh
    pnpm add jsx-email
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    ```sh
    npm install jsx-email
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
    ```sh
    yarn add jsx-email
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="bun">
    ```sh
    bun add jsx-email
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Nearly all installations of this package will want it installed into `devDependencies` so please make sure to add the `-D` flag.

## Usage

Installing this package will add an `email` binary, which will be available to `pnpm exec`, `npx`, and `yarn`.

Invoking the CLI without parameters or flags will produce help information in the console. From there, all of the functions of the CLI can be viewed, along with any applicable parameters and flags:

```console
→ pnpm exec email

jsx-email v0.0.0

A CLI for working with Email Templates made with jsx-email

Usage
  $ email [...options]

Commands
  build       <template file or dir path>
  check       <template file path>
  create      <template name>
  help        [<command>]
  preview     <template dir path>

Options
  --help      Displays this message
  --version   Displays the current jsx-email version

Examples
  $ email
  $ email --help
  $ email build ./src/templates/Invite.tsx
  $ email create invite
  $ email preview ./src/templates
```

To view help for specific commands, use `email help <command>`. e.g. `email help build`.

## Build

The `build` command compiles and renders an email template to HTML for use with an email provider. The command takes a directory or single file as input:

```console
cd ~/code/email-app
email build ./emails
```

Or for a single file:

```console
cd ~/code/email-app
email build ./emails/Batman.tsx
```

## Check

`jsx-email` can run a client compatibility check on any template, comparing it to the compatibility tables from `[caniuse.com](https://caniemail.com/) and display any email client incompatibility issues. This check is incredibly helpful in diagnosing and debugging display issues between multiple email clients.

```console
email check ./emails/Batman.tsx
```

Example output:

```console
Checking email template for Client Compatibility...

Found 1 files:
   ./emails/Batman.tsx

## Preview

JSX email ships with a Preview Tool as part of the CLI. Our Preview is fast, simple, and smooth. It doesn't require installing any crazy dependencies, downloading additional "clients," or copying your project's dependencies. It just works. And the best part: it works with monorepos out of the box.

To use the Preview Tool, open your terminal and navigate to your project. We're assuming you've already installed the CLI as shown above, and that you've already run `email create` to create an email in an `emails` directory.

```console
cd ~/code/email-app
email preview ./emails
```

The Preview Tool will start up and open a new window in your browser, and you'll be presented with a page that looks like:

<Image src={Preview_1} alt="Preview_1" />
<Image src={Preview_2} alt="Preview_2" />
<Image src={Preview_3} alt="Preview_3" />
<Image src={Preview_4} alt="Preview_4" />


## Deploying Your Preview App

As part of the CLI, users have the ability to build their templates into a deployable preview app. The resulting app can be deployed anywhere, not just select service providers. To build templates into a deployable app, run:

```console
email preview <templates-path> --build-path <build-path>
```

where `<build-path>` is the path you want the build output files placed.
