# Build single template
email build ./emails/Welcome.tsx
```

:::tip

### Check Command

Verify email client compatibility using [caniuse.com](https://caniemail.com/) data:

```console
email check ./emails/Welcome.tsx
```

Example output shows compatibility issues:

```console
Checking email template for Client Compatibility...

Found 1 files:
   ./emails/Welcome.tsx

[...]

Check Complete: 14 error(s), 20 warning(s)
```

:::tip
To view info, flags, and options for the `check` command, run `email help check`.
:::

### Preview Command

Launch a development server to preview your email templates with these features:

- Fast and lightweight preview environment
- Built-in support for monorepos
- Local static asset serving
- Hot-reloading

For a good example of how to handle local assets like images, please have a look at [the demo AirBnB template](https://github.com/shellscape/jsx-email/blob/main/apps/demo/emails/airbnb-review.tsx). Notice that `baseUrl` is set using a condition on `import.meta.isJsxEmailPreview`. That `import.meta` property is specific to `jsx-email` and will be replaced appropriately at build time. Local assets are served from the templates root directory, in this case `apps/demos/emails`, at the server root. So a `apps/demos/emails/batman.png` file would be served at `/batman.png` in the browser. We recommend using a `static` or `assets` directory in your templates root directory, so it's clear where files are being served from when viewing in the Preview Tool.

Launch the preview server:

```console
email preview ./emails
```

:::tip
To view info, flags, and options for the `preview` command, run `email help preview`.
:::

### Deploying Preview App

Create a deployable version of your preview environment:

```console
email preview <templates-path> --build-path <build-path>
```

This generates a standalone app that can be deployed to any hosting platform.
