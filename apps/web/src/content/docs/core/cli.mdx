## Command Line Interface

```console
→ pnpm exec email

  check       <template file path>
  create      <template name>
  help        [<command>]
  preview     <template dir path>

Options
  --help      Displays this message
  --version   Displays the current jsx-email version

Examples
  $ email
  $ email --help
  $ email build ./src/templates/Invite.tsx

```

## Available Commands

### Build Command

Build and compile email templates to HTML format:

```console
# Build entire directory
email build ./emails

# Build single template
email build ./emails/Welcome.tsx
```

:::tip

### Check Command

Verify email client compatibility using [caniuse.com](https://caniemail.com/) data:

```console
email check ./emails/Welcome.tsx
```

Example output shows compatibility issues:
```console
Checking email template for Client Compatibility...

Found 1 files:
   ./emails/Welcome.tsx

[...]

Check Complete: 14 error(s), 20 warning(s)
```

:::tip
To view info, flags, and options for the `check` command, run `email help check`.
:::

### Preview Command

Launch a development server to preview your email templates with these features:
- Fast and lightweight preview environment
- Built-in support for monorepos
- Local static asset serving
- Hot-reloading

For a good example of how to handle local assets like images, please have a look at [the demo AirBnB template](https://github.com/shellscape/jsx-email/blob/main/apps/demo/emails/airbnb-review.tsx). Notice that `baseUrl` is set using a condition on `import.meta.isJsxEmailPreview`. That `import.meta` property is specific to `jsx-email` and will be replaced appropriately at build time. Local assets are served from the templates root directory, in this case `apps/demos/emails`, at the server root. So a `apps/demos/emails/batman.png` file would be served at `/batman.png` in the browser. We recommend using a `static` or `assets` directory in your templates root directory, so it's clear where files are being served from when viewing in the Preview Tool.

Launch the preview server:
```console
email preview ./emails
```

:::tip
To view info, flags, and options for the `preview` command, run `email help preview`.

### Deploying Preview App

Create a deployable version of your preview environment:

```console
email preview <templates-path> --build-path <build-path>
```

This generates a standalone app that can be deployed to any hosting platform.
