title: Button legacy
description: A JSX email component which styles an anchor element to appear as a button
type: component
---
import Install from "@components/Install.mdx"

<p>{ frontmatter.description }</p>

:::tip
Semantics: Quite often in the email world we talk about buttons when we actually mean links. Behind the scenes this component is a `<a>` element which is styled like a `<button>` element.
:::

<Install type={frontmatter.type}/>

## Usage
Add the component to your email template. Include styles where needed.
```jsx
import { Button } from 'jsx-email';
const Email = () => {
  return (
    <Button href="https://example.com" style={{ color: '#61dafb', padding: '10px 20px' }}>
      Click me
    </Button>
  );
};
```
## Component Props

```ts
href: string;
```
The url to navigate to when the button is clicked.
```ts
target?: string;
```
Specifies the value of the `"target"` attribute for the button `target`.

:::tip
This component also expresses all of the [Common Component Props](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/common) for `ComponentProps<'a'>`.
