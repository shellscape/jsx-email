  A project to demo and test the `email preview` CLI command
  <br/>
<div>

The intent of this package is to provide a likely real-world scenario on which users might use `@jsx-email/cli` and its commands. Specifically the `preview` command, which starts a live-preview server.

## Requirements

This package requires an [LTS](https://github.com/nodejs/Release) Node version (v18.0.0+) and React v18.2.0+.

## Testing

To begin, you'll need to be setup to work within this repo. Please see _Getting Started_ in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) guide before continuing.

To start the preview server locally, run:

```console
$ moon run demo:dev
```

Open up the preview server [http://localhost:55420/](http://localhost:55420/)
