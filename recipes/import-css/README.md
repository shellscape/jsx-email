# üßÅ Importing CSS

If you're using a design system based on Styled Components or similar, and aren't using Tailwind, you may have the need to export that design system as CSS for use in jsx-email` templates. Or, you may be raw-dogging CSS straight up. For either scenario, importing CSS directly may be useful when crafting your email templates. jsx-email ships with the ability to import CSS as a string for use in your templates.

This recipe contains code to demonstrate how.

## Run the Recipe

To run this recipe, please open the terminal or console of your choice, and navigate to the directory this file resides in. Then, run:
