# Auth is handled via GitHub Actions OIDC in CI and via user-level ~/.npmrc locally.
# No project-level tokens are configured here.
# Local developers: configure npm auth in your personal ~/.npmrc for publish/private registry access.
# Note: with `always-auth=true`, ensure you have valid credentials configured in ~/.npmrc
# if you need to access private registries or publish.
