This project was built upon prior work for `react-email` by Bu Kinoshita ([@bukinoshita](https://twitter.com/bukinoshita)) and Zeno Rocha ([@zenorocha](https://twitter.com/zenorocha)).

`JSX email` is a fork of `react-email`. The goals of this project are to provide similar benefits, with an improved focus on Developer Experience, maintenance, fast improvements and fast releases. Improvements over `react-email` include:

- Smoother Developer Experience (DX)
- Better Command Line tools
- Less complex, smoother Preview Server
- Faster improvements and releases
- Community-driven maintenance
- No vendor lock-in for tools. `jsx-email` uses only generic components and tools.
